*---Overview---*
Data Fusion and Reshaping are essential operations in data processing, particularly when working with large and complex datasets. These techniques help to combine data from multiple sources, reorganize data into more insightful structures, and enable more effective analysis.

#####  Data Fusion
Data Fusion refers to the process of combining data from two or more different datasets to create a unified and comprehensive dataset. This is often done by using a common column or key shared between the datasets. The goal of data fusion is to enrich the data, bringing together relevant information from different sources.
For instance, when dealing with multiple sources of information about a car (e.g., one dataset containing car specifications and another containing pricing), data fusion can combine these datasets based on a common column like the car model, thereby creating a more complete view of the car's characteristics.
The key idea behind data fusion is to merge data without losing any relevant information, ensuring that the final dataset is richer and more insightful for analysis.

#### Reshaping
Reshaping refers to the process of changing the structure of a dataset, usually to make it more suitable for analysis. Reshaping typically involves transforming data from one format to anotherâ€”often from a wide format to a long format (or vice versa).
Reshaping is important because different types of analyses or visualizations may require the data to be structured in specific ways. For example, pivoting or melting are two common reshaping techniques.

#### Pivoting
Pivoting is the process of transforming a dataset where each row represents an observation and each column represents a variable. Pivoting allows you to summarize and aggregate the data by "spreading" unique values from one column into new columns.
Pivoting is useful when you want to aggregate data or restructure it in a way that allows for easier analysis, such as summarizing sales by product category or calculating the average price by model. It can be thought of as converting long-format data into wide-format data.

###### Melting
Melting is the opposite of pivoting. It involves transforming wide-format data into long-format data. Melting essentially "unspreads" columns into rows, making it easier to handle situations where each observation is spread across multiple columns.
Melting is particularly useful when you have a dataset with multiple variables in separate columns and want to transform it into a format where each variable is in its own row. This long-format data is ideal for many types of visualizations and analyses, such as time series or categorical analyses.
